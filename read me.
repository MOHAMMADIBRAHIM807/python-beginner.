Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.

Python Arithmetic Operators are as follows:
+	Addition	        x + y	
-	Subtraction	      x - y	
*	Multiplication	  x * y	
/	Division	        x / y	
%	Modulus	          x % y	(it return the remainder value.)
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	 
//	Floor division or integer divion	x // y ( it will give us value in integer instead of floating values.)

Python Comparison Operators are as follow:
==	Equal	                   x == y	
!=	Not equal	               x != y	
>	Greater than	              x > y	
<	Less than	                  x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to     x <= y

Python Logical Operators are as follows:
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	                  x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	  Returns True if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 or x < 4	
not 	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

THE ABOVE OPERATORS ARE BASICS,THERE ARE MANY MORE OPERATORS,WE WILL DEAL WITH IT SOON!
