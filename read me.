Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.

Python Arithmetic Operators are as follows:
+	Addition	        x + y	
-	Subtraction	      x - y	
*	Multiplication	  x * y	
/	Division	        x / y	
%	Modulus	          x % y	(it return the remainder value.) any no.%10 = last digit of the no.
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	 
//	Floor division or integer divion	x // y ( it will give us value in integer instead of floating values.)

Python Comparison Operators are as follow:
==	Equal	                   x == y	
!=	Not equal	               x != y	
>	Greater than	              x > y	
<	Less than	                  x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to     x <= y

Python Logical Operators are as follows:
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	                  x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	  Returns True if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 or x < 4	
not 	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

Conditional and loop statements.
if(): indentation is necessary.
else():
elif():

loops;
while():
for():

Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.

Method	Description
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	Returns a copy of the list
count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	Sorts the list
